# Design and Implementation of a Single-Cycle and Multi-Cycle RISC-V Processor 

This repository contains **two implementations of a custom RISC-V RV32I processor**:

1. **Single-Cycle Processor**  
2. **Multi-Cycle Processor**

These two RISC-V processor implementations were developed and tested to analyze architectural trade-offs in terms of performance, hardware resource utilization, and control logic complexity.

## Single-Cycle Processor

The **Single-Cycle Processor** executes every instruction in **one clock cycle**.  

- **Memory**: Separate instruction memory and data memory (Harvard architecture)  
- **Control**: Combinational logic  
- **Pros**: Simple to understand and implement  
- **Cons**: Long clock period due to critical path  

**Key Features**:  
- Supports R, I, L, S, and SB types  
- Modular design for easy debugging  
- Fully verified with test programs  

For more details, see the [Single-Cycle README](single_cycle/README.md).

## Multi-Cycle Processor

The **Multi-Cycle Processor** executes each instruction over **multiple clock cycles**.  

- **Memory**: Unified instruction and data memory (Von Neumann architecture)  
- **Control**: FSM-based control unit  
- **Pros**: Shorter clock period, hardware reuse  
- **Cons**: More complex control  

**Key Features**:  
- Supports R, I, L, S, and SB types  
- Unified memory for instructions and data  
- Fully verified with cycle-by-cycle simulation  

For more details, see the [Multi-Cycle README](multi_cycle/README.md).

## Comparison Between the Two

| Feature | Single-Cycle | Multi-Cycle |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Memory architecture | Harvard (separate) | Unified (Von Neumann) |
| Clock cycles per instruction | 1 | Multiple |
| Clock period | Long | Short |
| Control logic | Combinational | FSM-based |
| Hardware reuse | Low | High |
| Complexity | Low | Medium |

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Youssef647-gifs/RISC-V_Processor.git
```

2. Open either `single_cycle/` or `multi_cycle/` in a Verilog simulator (ModelSim recommended).  
3. Set the top module:
   - Single-Cycle → `top_tb_PLS` in `P_initialised.v`  
   - Multi-Cycle → `tb_riscv_mult` top module  
4. Run the simulation and observe waveforms to verify instruction execution.
